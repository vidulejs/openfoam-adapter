- Fixed a bug where a field was checkpointed, but doesn't exist anymore in OpenFOAM registry, causing a crash when reloading last timestep into OpenFOAM [#344](https://github.com/precice/openfoam-adapter/pull/344)
- Added new function 'pruneCheckpointedFields()' which is called before readCheckpoint().
